# MernSible â€“ Ansible Automation for MERN Stack

**MernSible** is an Ansible-based automation project that streamlines the deployment of a complete **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** environment.  
It is built around three modular roles:  

- **Comman** â†’ standard system setup and user management  
- **DBserver** â†’ automated MongoDB deployment and configuration  
- **Webserver** â†’ Node.js & React application setup and deployment  

This structure ensures **consistency, scalability, and security** across environments, making it ideal for development, testing, or production-ready deployments.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

MernSible simplifies the often complex process of provisioning and configuring infrastructure for modern web applications.  
With just a few Ansible playbooks, you can:  

- Standardize server setup (users, SSH keys, common packages).  
- Deploy a fully configured MongoDB database with authentication.  
- Launch a Node.js + React web application, managed by **pm2**.  

The modular roles allow flexibilityâ€”use them individually or together depending on your project needs.

## ðŸš€ Roles

### 1. Comman Role
Handles **baseline server setup**:  
- Updates packages and installs essential tools.  
- Creates users, groups, and SSH key pairs.  
- Ensures a secure and consistent configuration across all nodes.  

---

### 2. DBserver Role
Automates **MongoDB deployment and security**:  
- Installs MongoDB from the official repository.  
- Configures data directory, bind IP, and ports.  
- Creates root users with credentials.  
- Enables authentication for production-ready security.  

---

### 3. Webserver Role
Prepares and runs the **Node.js + React application stack**:  
- Installs Node.js, npm, and required global packages.  
- Creates and configures the app directory.  
- Bootstraps a React app with `create-react-app`.  
- Starts and manages the app with **pm2** for reliability.  
- Supports custom pages for branding or business needs.
